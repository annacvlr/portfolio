abstract = {Many researchers have studied the population dynamics of microbe of microbes as a typical example of population dynamics. The Monod equation, which mainly focuses on the growth and stationary phases, is used when plotting a growth curve. However, the growth potential in the late stage of culture has been overlooked. Previous studies considered the direct degradation of products to the limiting substrate. In this study, we considered microbial growth during the stationary phase, which enables us to describe the dynamics precisely. The microbes were divided into two populations: one grew by consuming the limiting substrate and the other degraded the products by metabolism. According to the numerical analysis of our model, microbes may choose one of two strategies: one consumes substrates and expands quickly, and the other grows slowly while cleaning up the environment in which they thrive. Furthermore, we found three types of microbial growth depending on their ability to detect metabolite accumulation. Using experimentally measured data, this model can estimate the dynamics of cell density, the substrates, and the metabolites used. The model’s disentangling of growth curves offers novel interpretive possibilities for culture system dynamics.}

    abstract = { ABSTRACT 
Lag phase represents the earliest and most poorly understood stage of the bacterial growth cycle. We developed a reproducible experimental system and conducted functional genomic and physiological analyses of a 2-h lag phase in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Adaptation began within 4 min of inoculation into fresh LB medium with the transient expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake. The main lag-phase transcriptional program initiated at 20 min with the upregulation of 945 genes encoding processes such as transcription, translation, iron-sulfur protein assembly, nucleotide metabolism, LPS biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration. ChIP-chip revealed that RNA polymerase was not “poised” upstream of the bacterial genes that are rapidly induced at the beginning of lag phase, suggesting a mechanism that involves de novo partitioning of RNA polymerase to transcribe 522 bacterial genes within 4 min of leaving stationary phase. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to discover that iron, calcium, and manganese are accumulated by S. Typhimurium during lag phase, while levels of cobalt, nickel, and sodium showed distinct growth-phase-specific patterns. The high concentration of iron during lag phase was associated with transient sensitivity to oxidative stress. The study of lag phase promises to identify the physiological and regulatory processes responsible for adaptation to new environments.

Sequencing both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis showed differences in the heat shock response.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an essential tool for characterizing gene expression in eukaryotes, but current methods are incompatible with bacteria. Here, we introduce microSPLiT (microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics), a high-throughput scRNA-seq method for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria that can resolve heterogeneous transcriptional states. We applied microSPLiT to \&gt;25,000 Bacillus subtilis cells sampled at different growth stages, creating an atlas of changes in metabolism and lifestyle. We retrieved detailed gene expression profiles associated with known, but rare, states such as competence and prophage induction and also identified unexpected gene expression states, including the heterogeneous activation of a niche metabolic pathway in a subpopulation of cells. MicroSPLiT paves the way to high-throughput analysis of gene expression in bacterial communities that are otherwise not amenable to single-cell analysis, such as natural microbiota.}}

Gene expression heterogeneity among isogenic bacteria is linked to clinically relevant scenarios, like biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance. The recent development of bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cell-to-cell variability in bacterial populations and the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.

ABSTRACT 
Bulk RNA sequencing technologies have provided invaluable insights into host and bacterial gene expression and associated regulatory networks. Nevertheless, the majority of these approaches report average expression across cell populations, hiding the true underlying expression patterns that are often heterogeneous in nature. Due to technical advances, single-cell transcriptomics in bacteria has recently become reality, allowing exploration of these heterogeneous populations, which are often the result of environmental changes and stressors. In this work, we have improved our previously published bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol that is based on multiple annealing and deoxycytidine (dC) tailing-based quantitative scRNA-seq (MATQ-seq), achieving a higher throughput through the integration of automation. We also selected a more efficient reverse transcriptase, which led to reduced cell loss and higher workflow robustness. Moreover, we successfully implemented a Cas9-based rRNA depletion protocol into the MATQ-seq workflow. Applying our improved protocol on a large set of single Salmonella cells sampled over different growth conditions revealed improved gene coverage and a higher gene detection limit compared to our original protocol and allowed us to detect the expression of small regulatory RNAs, such as GcvB or CsrB at a single-cell level. In addition, we confirmed previously described phenotypic heterogeneity in Salmonella in regard to expression of pathogenicity-associated genes. Overall, the low percentage of cell loss and high gene detection limit makes the improved MATQ-seq protocol particularly well suited for studies with limited input material, such as analysis of small bacterial populations in host niches or intracellular bacteria.
IMPORTANCE Gene expression heterogeneity among isogenic bacteria is linked to clinically relevant scenarios, like biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance. The recent development of bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cell-to-cell variability in bacterial populations and the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Here, we report a scRNA-seq workflow based on MATQ-seq with increased robustness, reduced cell loss, and improved transcript capture rate and gene coverage. Use of a more efficient reverse transcriptase and the integration of an rRNA depletion step, which can be adapted to other bacterial single-cell workflows, was instrumental for these improvements. Applying the protocol to the foodborne pathogen Salmonella, we confirmed transcriptional heterogeneity across and within different growth phases and demonstrated that our workflow captures small regulatory RNAs at a single-cell level. Due to low cell loss and high transcript capture rates, this protocol is uniquely suited for experimental settings in which the starting material is limited, such as infected tissues.

abstract = {The selection of a primary model to describe microbial growth in predictive food microbiology often appears to be subjective. The objective of this research was to check the performance of different mathematical models in predicting growth parameters, both by absorbance and plate count methods. For this purpose, growth curves of three different microorganisms (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli) grown under the same conditions, but with different initial concentrations each, were analysed. When measuring the microbial growth of each microorganism by optical density, almost all models provided quite high goodness of fit (r2 > 0.93) for all growth curves. The growth rate remained approximately constant for all growth curves of each microorganism, when considering one growth model, but differences were found among models. Three-phase linear model provided the lowest variation for growth rate values for all three microorganisms. Baranyi model gave a variation marginally higher, despite a much better overall fitting. When measuring the microbial growth by plate count, similar results were obtained. These results provide insight into predictive microbiology and will help food microbiologists and researchers to choose the proper primary growth predictive model.},

abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.}

The number of spoilage bacteria present when stored at 35 °C was significantly greater than when stored at lower temperatures, and maximum population size was achieved after 10 h. However, Bacillus pumilus, Dickeya zeae, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. Carotovorum Pcc21, and Bacillus pumilus (RDA-R) did not grow at the storage temperature of 5 °C. The biofilm formation by Clavibacter michiganensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and A. calcoaceticus (RDA-R) are higher than other spoilage bacteria. Biofilm formation showed low correlation between hydrophobicity, and no significant correlation with colony spreading. These results might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures, and could be basic information on the growth characteristics and biofilm formation properties of spoilage bacteria from fresh produce.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE. }

In this case, the apparent activation energy for growth (μ) was dependent on source of isolate and growth medium. For isolates from pasteurized cream, μ values were lower during growth in double cream than those obtained during growth in full-fat milk. This was due to shorter generation times at lower temperatures when these isolates were grown in double cream.

Bacteriol. 83:551–555. 1962.—The effect of temperature on growth of seven members of the genus Arthrobacter was determined at 0, 7, 20, 30, and 37 C. In general, no sharp cutoff point was observed between growth-temperature requirements of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria. There appeared to be a continuous gradation among members of this genus in ability to initiate and maintain growth at 0 C. The total number of generations produced was not greatly affected by incubation temperature, provided that growth occurred. However, the time required to attain maximal growth was greatest at psychrophilic temperatures. }

    abstract = { The effects of bacteria, temperature, light, nitrate, and orthophosphate on growth of and hepatotoxin (desmethyl-3-microcystin-RR) production by Oscillatoria agardhii strains were studied under laboratory conditions. Strains were cultivated in Z8 medium under continuous illumination. Growth was determined by measuring dry weight and chlorophyll a, while toxin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Two of the three toxic cultures studied produced more toxins in axenic than in nonaxenic cultures. High toxin production correlated with high nitrogen concentrations (test range, 0.42 to 84 mg of N per liter) and low light intensity (test range, 12 to 95 microeinsteins/m2 per s). Toxin production depended on phosphorus concentration at low levels of phosphorus (0.1 to 0.4 mg of P per liter) and higher concentrations had no additional effect. The optimum temperature for toxin production and growth of green O. agardhii was 25 degrees C. Red O. agardhii produced almost similar amounts of toxin at temperatures of 15 to 25 degrees C. The lowest toxin production by both strains was at 30 degrees C. }

Sigmoidal curves of best fit were calculated for the data with a computer program. Growth/temperature relationships were studied using two mathematical equations: the Arrhenius relationship (k = Ae-μ/RT) and the Square Root relationship (√r = b(T − To)). The Square Root equation was found to be the better description of the microbial growth/temperature relationship at chill temperatures and was also applicable to mixtures of organisms. Implications of these results in relation to food analysis are discussed.}

    abstract = { The temperature of chilled foods is an important variable for the shelf life of a product in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73\% of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93\% of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift. }

abstract = {Effective antibiotic use that minimizes treatment failures remains a challenge. A better understanding of how bacterial populations respond to antibiotics is necessary. Previous studies of large bacterial populations established the deterministic framework of pharmacodynamics. Here, characterizing the dynamics of population extinction, we demonstrated the stochastic nature of eradicating bacteria with antibiotics. Antibiotics known to kill bacteria (bactericidal) induced population fluctuations. Thus, at high antibiotic concentrations, the dynamics of bacterial clearance were heterogeneous. At low concentrations, clearance still occurred with a non-zero probability. These striking outcomes of population fluctuations were well captured by our probabilistic model. Our model further suggested a strategy to facilitate eradication by increasing extinction probability. We experimentally tested this prediction for antibiotic-susceptible and clinically-isolated resistant bacteria. This new knowledge exposes fundamental limits in our ability to predict bacterial eradication. Additionally, it demonstrates the potential of using antibiotic concentrations that were previously deemed inefficacious to eradicate bacteria.},

title = "Emergent Lag Phase in Flux-Regulation Models of Bacterial Growth",
abstract = "Lag phase is observed in bacterial growth during a sudden change in conditions: growth is inhibited whilst cells adapt to the environment. Bi-phasic, or diauxic growth is commonly exhibited by many species. In the presence of two sugars, cells initially grow by consuming the preferred sugar then undergo a lag phase before resuming growth on the second. Biomass increase is characterised by a diauxic growth curve: exponential growth followed by a period of no growth before a second exponential growth. Recent literature lacks a complete dynamic description, artificially modelling lag phase and employing non-physical representations of precursor pools. Here, we formulate a rational mechanistic model based on flux-regulation/proteome partitioning with a finite precursor pool that reveals core mechanisms in a compact form. Unlike earlier systems, the characteristic dynamics emerge as part of the solution, including the lag phase. Focussing on growth of Escherichia coli on a glucose-lactose mixture we show results accurately reproduce experiments. We show that for a single strain of E. coli, diauxic growth leads to optimised biomass yields. However, intriguingly, for two competing strains diauxic growth is not always the best strategy. Our description can be generalised to model multiple different microorganisms and investigate competition between species/strains.",

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of several mathematical functions for describing microbial growth curves. The nonlinear functions used were: three-phase linear, logistic, Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy, Richards, Morgan, Weibull, France and Baranyi. Two data sets were used, one comprising 21 growth curves of different bacterial and fungal species in which growth was expressed as optical density units, and one comprising 34 curves of colony forming units counted on plates of Yersinia enterocolitica grown under different conditions of pH, temperature and CO2 (time-constant conditions for each culture). For both sets, curves were selected to provide a wide variety of shapes with different growth rates and lag times. Statistical criteria used to evaluate model performance were analysis of residuals (residual distribution, bias factor and serial correlation) and goodness-of-fit (residual mean square, accuracy factor, extra residual variance F-test, and Akaike's information criterion). The models showing the best overall performance were the Baranyi, three-phase linear, Richards and Weibull models. The goodness-of-fit attained with other models can be considered acceptable, but not as good as that reached with the best four models. Overall, the Baranyi model showed the best behaviour for the growth curves studied according to a variety of criteria. The Richards model was the best-fitting optical density data, whereas the three-phase linear showed some limitations when fitting these curves, despite its consistent performance when fitting plate counts. Our results indicate that the common use of the Gompertz model to describe microbial growth should be reconsidered critically, as the Baranyi, three-phase linear, Richards and Weibull models showed a significantly superior ability to fit experimental data than the extensively used Gompertz.}
